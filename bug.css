The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the specificity of selectors leads to unexpected behavior.  The `#myId h2` selector is more specific than the `.myClass h2` selector. Therefore, the styles from the first selector override those from the second selector, even though `.myClass h2` appears later in the stylesheet. This is a common pitfall when working with CSS specificity, often leading to unexpected results and debugging challenges.
