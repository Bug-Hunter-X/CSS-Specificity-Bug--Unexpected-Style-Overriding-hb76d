# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS related to selector specificity. The bug showcases how a more specific selector can override a less specific one, even if it appears later in the stylesheet. The solution provides a way to resolve the conflict by adjusting the selectors or using the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged).
